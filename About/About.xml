&lt;size=24&gt;Create timelapses from PR renders&lt;/size&gt;
&lt;b&gt;[IMPORTANT] This mod requires Windows x64! Other operating systems are not supported&lt;/b&gt;

Using the &lt;b&gt;progress renderer mod&lt;/b&gt; you can make renders.
Tell Timelapse 2023 where they are, set your output quality
and it will make a timelapse for you.

Default output folder: My Documents/Rimworld Renders/

This mod (2000) was originally made by Epicguru (James B)

It is much appreciated in the
https://rimworld.gallery community.

Sadly, he announced abandoning it in 2020:

"As of May 2022, I will no longer be updating my Rimworld mods
until further notice, although if a new version of Rimworld
is released, I may make an effort to port my mods."

As people are asking for it to be updated and we are
now two Rimworld versions ahead, I (TVG) am now (Oct 2023)
taking over the maintenance of this mod.
I will not be improving it, just making it work on all Rimworld versions.

Epicguru, thanks for this mod!
